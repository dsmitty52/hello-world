Github Hello World Intro

My name is David Smith. I am interested in determining the needs of stacksholders accurately and producing timely and quality software.
In my free time, I enjoy playing video games on my PS4 or my RetroPie retro video game emulator. My favortite season is Fall, I think partially due to football season.
